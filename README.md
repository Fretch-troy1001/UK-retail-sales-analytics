# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis for UK Online Retail Store

## Project Briefing

**Scenario**  
We are data analysts hired by the management of a UK-based online retail store. They have provided us with a large dataset of their transactions.

**High-Level Goal**  
"We want to understand our sales performance and customer behavior to find ways to increase profitability."

**Mission**  
Our job is to turn this broad goal into specific, answerable questions and use the data to answer them. This process is the heart of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand sales performance and typical customer purchasing behavior.  

We aim to answer the following business questions:

1. How is our business performing on a monthly basis? *(Sales Trends)*
2. Which countries are our top markets?
3. What are our best-selling products?

## Step 1: Loading and Inspecting the Data

**Goal:** Perform a quick inspection to ensure the dataset was loaded correctly.

- Load the data  
- Check the number of rows and columns  
- Identify missing values  
- Inspect data types of each column

## Step 2: Data Cleaning

a. Remove useless columns  
b. Drop rows that are entirely null  
c. Remove duplicate rows  
d. Handle missing values in specific columns  
e. Filter irrelevant content  
f. Correct data types  
g. Handle outliers

## Step 4: Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the online retail dataset, the following key insights and actionable recommendations were developed.

### a. Sales Trend Analysis

**Interpretation:**  
The data reveals a strong and consistent seasonal sales pattern, with a significant revenue peak occurring in **November** of each year. This surge is driven by a corresponding influx of unique customers, suggesting that early holiday shopping or sales events—not last-minute December purchases—are the primary drivers of revenue.

**Recommendation:**  
Realign the business strategy to capitalize on the November peak:

- Concentrate the majority of the annual marketing spend from **late Q3 to mid-November**.
- Ensure that **critical inventory levels are maximized by October** to meet peak demand and prevent stockouts.

### b. Geographic Market Analysis

**Interpretation:**  
The business is heavily reliant on the **domestic UK market**, which generates the bulk of revenue. This concentration represents a potential risk. At the same time, large nearby markets like **Ireland and the Netherlands** show very low sales, highlighting a growth opportunity.

**Recommendation:**  
Adopt a dual strategy:

- **Protect the UK base** with customer retention initiatives such as loyalty programs and faster domestic shipping.
- Begin **targeted international expansion**, starting with small-scale marketing tests in countries like the Netherlands or Germany to diversify the customer base and revenue.

### c. Product Sales Analysis

**Interpretation:**  
A small number of products dominate overall sales, particularly **decorative homewares and party supplies**. The top-selling product is the “WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER.” High sales volumes suggest that **wholesale or B2B buyers** make up a significant portion of the demand.

**Recommendation:**  
Implement a three-part product strategy:

- Classify these high-performing items as **critical inventory** and keep them stocked year-round, especially before November.
- **Prominently feature top-sellers** across all marketing channels to increase engagement and conversions.
- **Explore and formalize a wholesale strategy**, such as creating a B2B portal with bulk pricing, to serve high-volume customers more effectively.
